            <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I am a student at the University of Wisconsin - Eau Claire. I am
    majoring in both Graphic Design and Business  Administration.
    I have several years of experience with design work, making
    me highly educated in various design software programs. In
    addition to design, I am also experienced in the filed of business.
    </p>
    <p>I am very passionate about the outdoors, as my favorite things
    to do are hunt and fish. Which is why I started my own business
    called Rax Hunting. Another hobby that I really enjoy doing
    in my free time is lifting weights.
